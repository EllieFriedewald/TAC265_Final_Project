    spent ~30 minutes drawing my UML diagram and coming up with broad categories of what the game (copy of Minecraft) would potentially run like. Next time: I would like to finalize my UML so that it has all of the instance variable and create my run menu.

    I spent the second half of class today finalizing my run program for the game and kind of allocating all of my variables to the classes (figuring out logistics so i can just code. I finished the POJO of Player, Mob, and Entity (adding the abstract method- dropItem()).

    Next time:
    I would love to finalize my Entity & WorldObject hierarchy.

    this session I probably worked on this session for an hour- I implemented all of the POJO for my second hierarchy (WorldObject) I am not done with it but I have a workout class to go to so I will be returning to this after that and before my friends birthday party. I want to complete all of my enums, POJO and interfaces before the first checkpoint to night... we shall see how that goes.
