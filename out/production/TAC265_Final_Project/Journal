    spent ~30 minutes drawing my UML diagram and coming up with broad categories of what the game (copy of Minecraft) would potentially run like. Next time: I would like to finalize my UML so that it has all of the instance variable and create my run menu.

    I spent the second half of class today finalizing my run program for the game and kind of allocating all of my variables to the classes (figuring out logistics so i can just code. I finished the POJO of Player, Mob, and Entity (adding the abstract method- dropItem()).

    Next time:
    I would love to finalize my Entity & WorldObject hierarchy.

    this session I probably worked on this session for an hour- I implemented all of the POJO for my second hierarchy (WorldObject) I am not done with it but I have a workout class to go to so I will be returning to this after that and before my friends birthday party. I want to complete all of my enums, POJO and interfaces before the first checkpoint to night... we shall see how that goes.

    This session I coded for like 30 ish minutes and I finished up my WorldObject hierarchy, also did my craftable interface, and did my enumns!! Super proud of this session as I thought I wouldnt get much done (Was tempted to put on a show, but I didnt, and the mouse thats been living in my stove finally got killed in our trap, so that all happend in the 30 mins along with my coding). I realized over today how hard this project is if you dont have a structured plan of what everything is and where everything needs to be/ what everything needs to be! So from now im also writing on my iPad everything I do... I have also forgot to mention every session including the previous ones ive been pushing to git hub so I can work between my laptop and my home pc as well as if I forget to upload to edstem I have backup proof of what ive done, and it can be great for my portfolio!

    Next time- start and finish control package and maybe start on my run program :)

    Man, today was a long day, had my first final at 4:30pm so I was studying since sunday for that.. So right now was the first time I looked at my code from sunday's session. Currently in Leavey Library writing this while along side all of my scope club who are studying for their linear algebra exam... I wish I could insert a picture its actually really wholesome. Anyway, Ive probably been here for an hour just basically copying the structure for my Serializable instance for this project that we used in A11 (that kendra wrote)... I just wanted to make sure I hit the checkpoint today which is why I copied the structure. I also wrote in my run function and started working on the methods.
    Next time (later today since its 12:02 am) I will try to finish up all of the methods for the run section and be able to full run my program with just the MyUI ui so that the final time I work on this (friday) I can just work on the popUp UI and the paper (I need this done prior to 9pm CST Friday. see yah next time! XD

    I was coding for 2 hours just figuring out my mineblock logic and writing in my excel files (for txt), and what I did was exactly that. Firgured that I needed to read in from that file and put it into a map so that it can randomized out many items are dropped when mined... more to come on my flight at midnight...

    Finally in Chicago, ive been coding on my couch for roughly 4 hours! I completed most of the functions in my run program... I still have to add a few more features like the upgrade method and more.

    Took a poritllos itallian beef and deep dish pizza break to welcome me back home lol. I worked from 8:30-1:45am ish and all I was doing was trying to fix my writing to file situation... my playerDatabase would not save correctly and would delete my saved players... so annoying and I didnt know how tofix it. so I went onto work with the mob class and implement the attack method.
